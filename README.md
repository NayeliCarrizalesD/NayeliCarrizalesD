# 🌱 About me
I am an information and communication technology engineer with a focus on Front-end, proactive and constantly updating, since I believe that we never stop learning and it is important to be prepared. I always seek to have a good relationship with my work teams and colleagues. Cooperating with everyone and supporting in the best way possible.
