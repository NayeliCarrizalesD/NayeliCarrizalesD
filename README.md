# 👋 Hi, I’m @NayeliCarrizalesD
I´m passionate about web development with a great motivation to learn and work with new technologies. I specialize in creating modern and efficient applications, combining my knowledge in React with PostgreSQL databases to develop dynamic and scalable solutions.

In addition, I have experience in projects with HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript, which allows me to thoroughly understand how the frontend works and optimize the user experience. I consider myself a responsible, committed and constantly learning person, always looking to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest technological trends.
# 🌱 About me
I'm an information and communication technology engineer with a focus on Front-end, proactive and constantly updating, since I believe that we never stop learning and it is important to be prepared. I always seek to have a good relationship with my work teams and colleagues. Cooperating with everyone and supporting in the best way possible.
